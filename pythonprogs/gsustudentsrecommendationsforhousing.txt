student housing on campus or living in midtown is ur best bet
if u want to be relatively close
price range is 950-1500 depending on ur living situation
if u live around there commute is 30-45 mins
if u live further it's an hour and ur commute might be worse depending on delays and available bus services
expenses also vary if it's not Marta
Do not live in West End. Do not stay in One12. Do not stay in Westmar. Do not stay in anything you haven't checked the reviews for.
Focus on security and safety for ur expectations, visit the place before u buy and get to know the roommates/KNOW who you are living with. This is the BIGGEST priority because this will dictate ur stress levels.
If you cannot afford midtown or downtown and dont wanna have the long ass commute, stay home and drive 
those are my tips from my extensive apartment searching
